## Name
Work Day Scheduler 
## Description
Use this scheduler to save events for each hour and get an up-to-date view of the current, past, and present hour. This program uses Dayjs to pull and compare to your current time zones. 


## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
Thank you to DU Coding Bootcamp for the starter code.
